# Cesium's Blocking Rules 

i hate a lot of things and this makes them go away

## [YouTube](https://github.com/CesiumCs/bullshitblaster/blob/master/ublock-youtube.txt)

i guess just paste it into the "my filters" tab of uBlock settings, maybe itll work with other blockers idk i dont use other blockers

## [Discord (with Vencord)](https://github.com/CesiumCs/bullshitblaster/blob/master/vencord.css)

i just put all this stuff in my QuickCSS file you can find in the main vencord settings, its worth looking through and modifying it
to not remove anything you wanna keep, my preferences probably wont match yours
